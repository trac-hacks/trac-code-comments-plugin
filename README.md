Code Comments, an enhancement for Trac
=====================================

The problem is two-fold. When reviewing code, it's difficult to
associate your comments with their appropriate context. Then,
collecting all of these new issues into actionable tickets requires
a lot of manual effort.

This plugin allows you to leave comments on top of files, changesets, and
attachments. Once you've added all of your comments, you can send them to
tickets. These include links to these comments and their description.

It's GitHub, in your Trac.

Installation
------------

Pick an `.egg` file from the Downloads section and place it in the `plugins/`
directory of your Trac install.

Trac Code Comments plugin requres at least python 2.4 and runs on Trac 0.12.

Features
--------

* Comments on files – you can comment on every file in the repository.

* Inline comments on files – comment on a specific line. The comments appears
in context, below the line in question.

* Comments on changesets – useful when doing code reviews of incoming commits.

* Inline comments on changesets - comment on a specific line of the changeset.

* Comments on attachment pages – useful when reviewing patches.

* Wiki Markup – you can use the standard Trac wiki markup inside your
comments.

* Instant preview – to make sure you get the formatting right.

* Sending comments to tickets – you can select arbitrary number of comments
and create a new ticket out of them. The text of the ticket defaults to links
to the comments and their text, but you can edit these before saving the
ticket.

* Comments/ticket cross-reference – to remember which comments are already in
tickets and which are not.
